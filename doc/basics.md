## Learning Algorithms

Here we *assume* the statistical theory of DNNs are right, so what DNNs are interpreted in this theory?

Generally we feed forward samples gathered in the real world through our neural network and minimize the differences between labels and the outputs.

Say we have a cluster of labeled dataset(x -> y) and we train neural network on this dataset. a well trained network will help us predicting y from given x(x might be seen or unseen).
